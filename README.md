> **NOTE: This plugin is not working correctly on Handlebars, Mustache and probably other template engines**. Jade works fine and probably other template engines which support calling directly on properties should work. [See #3](https://github.com/doup/metalsmith-i18n/issues/3)

# metalsmith-i18n

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doup/metalsmith-i18n.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doup/metalsmith-i18n)

Use `__()` and `__n()` in your templates for translating your strings. Based on the [i18n](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) library.

## Installation

    $ npm install --save metalsmith-i18n

## Usage

Add the plugin with the required options (it also accepts [`i18n` module](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) options). This will add `__` and `__n` methods to each file:

```javascript
var i18n = require('metalsmith-i18n');

Metalsmith(__dirname)
    .use(i18n({
        default:   'es',
        locales:   ['en', 'es'],
        directory: 'locales'
    }))

```

If the file has a `locale` property this will be used by default, otherwise it'll fallback to the given `default` locale:

```
---
locale: en
---

Some content.
```

Just call `__` or `__n` in your templates (depending on your templating engine):

```
<%= __('hello') %>
${__('hello')}
```

When calling `__` or `__n` the locale can be overriden:

```
__('key', { locale: 'en' })
__n('key_n', 'key_n', 3, { locale: 'en' })
```

You can see more usage examples in `test/index.js`.

## Options

**default** `String` (required): Default locale for the translations.

**locales** `Array` (required): List of supported locales. A JSON file for each locale will be created automatically in the locales directory.

**directory** `String` (required): Path to the locales directory relative to the Metalsmith working directory.

## Tests

`npm test` to run the tests.
